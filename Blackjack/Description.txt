This is a program to play blackjack in a Computer.
I plan to have a "fair play" mode, which is regular unassisted blackjack, a "light assisted" mode, which would count cards (Hi-Lo), another one that'd be "heavy assisted", which would show in realtime the number of each card remaining in the deck, an "ultra-heavy assisted" that would also calculate the odds of winning for each move (draw, stand, split). Finally an autonomous which would just play itself with the ultra assists and basically try to win as much as possible. That one would be especially for testing betting patterns.
